      "['in 2020 india became the 5th largest automobile market in the world.', 'while this fact is good news for the automobile industry, it is also bad news for the environment.', 'how?', 'well, india is also the 3rd largest oil-consuming and green house gas (ghg) emitting nation.', 'according to the assessment report (ar6) of the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), during the 2020 lockdown, even though the complete economy was shut yet 36 out of 50 big cities in india had unhealthy air quality.taking into account the current situation where according to studies, vehicles annually contribute about 290 giga grams of pm2, at the same time, around 8 percent of total ghg (green house gas) emissions in india are from the transport sector and in delhi, it exceeds 30 percent and also in the account of the promises made by india on decreasing carbon emissions niti ayog wants to electrify india’s 2w segment by 2025 and the 3w segment by 2030. india has aimed to create 100 percent electric vehicle (ev) use by 2030. while experts say that this goal is quite ambitious and a hybrid of both electric vehicles (evs) and internal combustion engines (ices) may be seen in india for another decade but india is ushering itself towards itsgoal in a much faster fashion.', 'and let me give you a few reasons behind it:\\uf0b7 so basically, since the war between ukraine and russia seems to be never-ending and russia is an exporter of crude petroleum to the world, the rates of petroleum in the international market are skyrocketing and india is the 3rd largest oil-consuming nation and 90 percent of this oil is being imported, a lot of india’s money is being driven towards that which needs to be controlled.\\uf0b7 moreover, after the lockdown people are trying to stay at distance from each other and thus the people who can afford are trying to use personal vehicles instead of public ones.', 'this is why india is on its way to becoming the largest market for automobiles, given the population.\\uf0b7 the effect of rising oil prices (touching the 100rs mark now and then) can be seen in other products as well, transportation costs increasing inflation of course.therefore the government is hoping to control our import bills with evs (electric vehicles) and hydrogen running vehicles.', 'but (no matter what is being said, there’s always a but in india) here’s a catch if the hasty push is being done then that may further increase our country’s import bill.', 'how?', 'well, currently most of the ev components are imported from china, yet nothing much to worry about, huge indian automobile industries are trying to make evs (electric vehicles) completely made in india, you just need to be informed and smart consumer.now let’s see what the government is doing about the issue currently:\\uf0b7 since battery costs 70 percent of the total manufacturing cost of an ev (electrical vehicle), morth (ministry of road transport and highways) is considering ‘battery as a service business model.\\uf0b7 the government has allotted a budget of about 100 crores in its latest budget.\\uf0b7 the government is working on applying the fame ii policy wherein it will spend 86 percent on consumer incentives and 10 percent on charging infrastructure.\\uf0b7 the government is trying to attract fdis and take help with the import of li (lithium) to make batteries.\\uf0b7 the government has also promised to build charging infrastructure.the government has also launched an e-portal that is e-amrit.niti.gov on cop26 summit in glasgow.', 'the portal gives an insight into the major benefits of using evs (electric vehicles).', 'the major benefits talked about are:\\uf0b7 zero tailpipe emission (zte)\\uf0b7 lower running cost\\uf0b7 lower maintenance\\uf0b7 less tax\\uf0b7 environmental benefits\\uf0b7 easy to drive\\uf0b7 quiteyou might feel that the government is adamant about its “ice to ev by 2030” mission, yet let’s talk about what government can add to this mission.\\uf0b7 the double dividend hypothesis by david pearce in 1991 states that environmentaltaxation can improve economic and environmental conditions and recyclingrevenues obtained to reduce other pre-existing taxes.\\uf0b7 norway provides no toll and free parking to people using evs as an incentive.\\uf0b7 sweden and france give tax levitation to people using evs.now let’s chitchat a bit upon the problems that consumers think might come if they switch toevs:\\uf0b7 short driving range of evs\\uf0b7 long battery recharge time\\uf0b7 lack of charging infrastructure\\uf0b7 higher cost\\uf0b7 battery life\\uf0b7 high cost of commercial electricity\\uf0b7 poor roadsif india is looking forward to an ev future then it has to build a good road network because it isproven that carbon emission by ice is lesser on good roads and the driving range of evs is alsogreater on good roads.now let’s talk about how will this affect livelihood in the future that is by 2040. so let me give yousome of my and some of the expert’s predictions to conclude this article :\\uf0b7 according to crew report demand for power is expected to rise by 80 percent.\\uf0b7 about 75 percent of vehicles will be evs.\\uf0b7 this will usher in the use of railways for large distances.\\uf0b7 let’s not forget air transport as well.\\uf0b7 transportation cost of goods to decrease\\uf0b7 imports to decrease in large amounts.\\uf0b7 empty petrol stations (better if converted to charging stations)\\uf0b7 and me writing and you reading about self-solarized evs.the last one was obvious (chuckles) but since you have read me so far, allow me to share a small, additional yet important information that will be summarized by my last prediction.', 'so, there is this ev trade route that happens to have the philippines, japan, and the us.', 'and here the philippines extracts ni (nickel) for batteries of evs from rio tuba, a mine, japan purifies it and the us makes batteries out of them and uses them in evs.', 'now since demand is increasing, the mining of rio tuba is increasing too which is affecting the rainforests of the philippines and its

new sectors for growth, ultimately leading to the creation of more jobs.', 'while ai has made major strides toward replicating the efficacy of human intelligence in executing certain tasks, there are still major limitations.', 'in particular, ai programs are typically only capable of “specialized” intelligence, meaning they can solve only one problem, and execute only one task at a time.', 'often, they can be rigid, and unable to respond to any changes in input, or perform any “thinking” outside of their prescribed programming.', 'humans, however, possess “generalized intelligence,” with the kind of problem-solving, abstract thinking, and critical judgment that will continue to be important in business.', 'human judgment will be relevant, if not in every task, then certainly throughout

question the availability of the right kind of data, and highlighting the need for categorization and issues of privacy and security around such data.', 'there is also the limitation of computation and processing power.', 'the cost of electricity alone to power one supercharged language model ai was estimated at $4.6 million.', 'another important limitation of note is that data can itself carry bias, and be reflective of societal inequities or the implicit biases of the designers who create and input the data.', 'if there is bias in the data that is inputted into an ai, this bias is likely to carry over to the results generated by the ai.there has even been a bill introduced into congress entitled the algorithmic accountability act with the goal of forcing the federal trade commission to investigate the use of any new ai technology for the potential to perpetuate bias.', 'based on these factors and many others, the mit cci paper argues that we are a long way from reaching a point in which ai is comparable to human intelligence, and could theoretically replace human workers entirely.', 'provided there is an investment at all levels, from education to the private sector and governmental organizations—anywhere that focuses on training and upskilling workers—ai has the potential to ultimately create more jobs, not less.', 'the question should then become not “humans or

'entails for the future?a.i.', 'is fancy enough to continue existing in our minds all the time, but it does come with certain limitations and threats which is a cause for a peaceful sleep for most of the workers.', 'with its introduction to different areas of the workplace, it is clear that half of the human jobs would be taken up by a.i.', 'and then there would arise a need for more jobs for humans in new upcoming ai-based ventures in different industries.', 'thereby giving us our fair share back to us.in a survey, it was found that some believed that ai will be devastating for humans and while some professionals and tech-savvy people believed that inculcating ai technology into business and our daily lives would be a remarkable step as it will lead to the flourishment of business in the future and give them a competitive edge over their rivals.people believed that when these advanced technologies would come together to work with humans, they will produce a smarter strategic decision with productive collaborative practices.', 'more modern technology prevailing in the organization will lead to stress reduction and produce more satisfying results thereby making the organization more efficient.the organizations who are in use of the ai technology responds by saying that their managers are more comfortable using a.i.', 'and are accustomed to it and the organizations are now looking forward to having integration of higher-end technology systems, as it is believed that new technology will result in more productivity thereby making more profits in the long run.many jobs today require ai and humans working in collaboration, which creates a positive signal that in the future to humans would be working closely with the technology.', 'beyond just training and developing these machines, humans would be working in close vicinity with them and making decisions on how to act on the result that is given by the machine.it can be said that both the ai advanced technology and human can’t remain in the workforce without each other, as the technology will produce accurate and top-notch results but it requires someone to make delivery.e.g., in a firm, an ai-based system produces results based on historical data but there is a need for someone to analyze and communicate and present this data to the respective stakeholders whether inside or outside of the organization.various uses of artificial intelligence technology in day-to-day functions in regards to interactions with humans are:chatbotsemail curationa.i.', 'powered advertisingautomated image recognitionself-sufficient drivingvoice activation and much more.here in this figure a represents ‘artificial intelligence’ and b represents ‘humans’artificial intelligence as we know works on algorithms, neural networks, and deep learning which all are analytical tools that help ai in taking analytical decisions based on the data provided.whereas, humans on the other hand take higher-level decisions based on ‘intuition’ sometimes, which refers to the gut feeling that generates in humans concerning any situation or challenge.ai alone can’t work to handle critical situations on its own as it needs humans for it to reciprocate them and share the information with stakeholders, and humans alone can’t anticipate much on the accurate and fast-paced analytical solutions to the problems persisting in place of the situation.the strength of humans and ai working in synergy can be surprisingly beneficial and advantageous to organizations.artificial intelligence and jobsit is believed that machines in the future would be eating up our traditional jobs.', 'but the reality seems to be turning otherwise.the future trend shows that in future the ai-powered technology would take up jobs that were being done by humans but in return would produce more jobs that would require human interference with them.', 'as and when the newer technology is approaching more and more countries are now proceeding towards gig economies, and so in the future, we can witness an increase in freelance jobs and the permanent labor market norms could reduce drastically.some of the jobs today will be replaced by ai which is in the transportation or retail commerce sector that can be 100% automated in the future years.', 'there is an ‘amazon go’ store that uses this technology which goes by the name ‘just walk out technology’ wherein there is no need for any human-induced workforce and all the operations are carried out by ai-powered technologies, which is indeed a breakthrough technology in today’s world.rather than eating up our jobs ai in return will be creating more jobs in the future by creating massive innovations thereby fueling up many new industries and thereby giving us our fair share of jobs back.there will be a lot of demand placed on the upcoming young workforce which is also categorized as ‘gen z’.', 'they are expected to know more about technology and would be high in demand.', 'these young generations are required to learn new skills which are needed to survive in the dynamic changing environment, and as most of the activities that are carried out by workers will be automated, there will be demand for people working in the back office and maintaining and developing the technology to its best versions.artificial intelligence and its constraintsai powered technology has its limitations which makes it a rigid system to hold on to and also which makes it a costly affair at the initial stage.it was predicted that the cost of electricity to power a supercharged ai model was around $4.6 million.', 'so, this super-powered ai can be purchased only by big fortune firms and thereby creating more value to their net worth.one of the major limitations of ai is that it can contain biased data as the scientists who put in the data can create biasedness and so the resultant output of the same would have a biased report.these machines as do not have neuroscience-based technology in them yet which enables them to carry human emotions to understand complex situations and a creative way out of that, they tend to have a lack of out of box thinking which in the case is rigid in themselves as they are programmed to work on a single task and they cannot perform more than a single task at the same time.it is also believed

important to be clear-eyed about displacement and unintended consequences like any other technology and work both skills so that people can find the jobs of the future create new jobs also the policy decisions that help people as they go through this change people already unhappy because of machine learning artificial intelligence as they think if they’re not innovative enough or not creative enough your job will be taking away by a lot of machines ai for business going to affect the future of work specifically there are jobs that are at more risk of being taken over by ai and automation there is very wide dissonance on this, there are different reports that have been shared by oxford study that says 47% of us jobs are at risk of automation over the next few years meanwhile the general population and workers think differently a recent study conducted by college actually identifies that 97% of workers believe that most jobs will be automated but not their own this suggests that the general public needs to be educated on which jobs are susceptible to this risk which are not and businesses need to be aware of the forthcoming skills gap of course not all jobs are equal the oxford study that highlights this they examined 700 participants and found the generalist occupations that require creative knowledge or innovation are at least risk the same is true for occupations in education healthcare media and arts jobs on the flip side jobs like telemarketers junior lawyers accountants are at most risk in short there is a simple rule of thumb if your job is in some way predictable or routine the risk of automation is much higher if a job doesn’t require innovation or creativity then the return on investment for companies is higher on machines than real-time employees machines are faster can’t be distracted and can work 24/7 this is actually good for creative marketers because ai and automation can serve to augment their jobs rather than substituting them as impact of emerging technologies on the creative economy they stated that artificial intelligence is changing creative content from beginning to end by 2030 ai will be able to write high school essays code in python composed top 40s chart songs and make creative videos but all of these advancements also come with risks and costs take a look at this report by the global commission on the future of work in the absence of effective transition policies many people will have to accept lower skilled and lower paying jobs high-skilled workers are taking less cognitively demanding jobs displacing less educated workers and this is already happening also technological dividends are being unevenly distributed among firms a very limited amount of companies tend to dominate when it comes to big data just think about google and facebook today they alone are responsible for 70% of the referral marketing traffic and receive more than 50% of total global advertising budget so the question is in businesses workers and social institutions go into the same direction if companies and public policy leaders can understand the evolving landscape they can help the workforce anticipate the upcoming challenges technology and the demographic changes are leading to a smaller workforce compared to the previous generation and a workforce that has to pursue many careers during their time of work we need to provide workers with an environment where they can continuously upskill and grow governments will have to re-evaluate the educational system we will have to continuously learn and grow and companies will have to redesign their structure and their culture around technology just like during the industrial revolution we are heading into a new age and the great transformation that we’re about to see by 2022 it is estimated that 20 to 25 percent of the labor force will be displaced within 10 to 20 years however this is also an opportunity for people to get ahead for which different ways have to be find to attract and retain highly skilled workers and allow them the time to up skill themselves even during work hours and it is a good way to develop a learning community to benefit from each other and also to use technology to supplement goal tracking and efforts instead of as a distraction in short what we are doing is to bridge the dissonance and it is imperative to build a map of how ai and automation will affect industry and company if this is an economic imperative how do people feel about committing itself to a lifelong approach to knowledge as these risks are important but it is important to do things like from being upfront to have ethical charters like ai safety and to be very transparent and open and how we perceive progress there and figure out global frameworks by which we can engage just like paris agreement and climate change by using such forums bring people together as they engage on the hard questions and it will emerge answers and on the question of whether ai is a threat or not, artificial intelligence is not a threat because there is a rare case where people need to be proactive in regulation instead of reactive because i think by the time we are reactive in ai regulation it’s too late right now we have machine learning algorithms that can solve an incredibly complex problem beyond any human intelligence as they are mere machines that can be given enormous data set and they come up with brilliant correlations and insights but they’re not going threaten the human population anytime soon because fish intelligent isn’t terrible but human being a smart enough to learn that skills at least to have a complete toolbox to be prepared volatility of the future adaptability.blackcoffer insights 28: mihir bhatt, delhi

developed and developing countries.the sars- cov2 came into the spotlight in december 2019 and has impacted most of the countries till then.', 'nearly 131 million peoples were infected worldwide and resulting in deaths of around 2.9 million according to world health organisation (who).', 'most of the countries dealt with the new virus by imposing strict lockdowns and social distancing to control the spread of the virus.', 'these policies caused adverse effects worldwide.', 'one of the most important impacts of the covid-19 pandemic is on the environment.there have been few positive impacts on the environment due to lockdown like, air pollution has decreased dramatically, as people were asked to stay in their houses due to the lockdowns.', 'there has also been a sharp decline in environmental noise.', 'environmental noise can be well defined as the unwanted or harmful outdoor sounds caused by human activities like noise emitted by road traffics, air traffics, rail traffics, and industrial activities.', 'it is one of the most important challenges in the modern era as noise pollution can cause adverse effects on humans as well as harm many animals too.', 'the imposition of lockdown and quarantine by various nation’s governments has caused people to remain back at their homes.', 'because of this, the movement of people from one place to a different place has reduced significantly and the use of personal and public transport has also decreased.', 'due to all these changes, the environmental noise generated in most of the cities has dropped substantially.water pollution at beaches have reduced significantly and many animals were spotted back in the cities, but the covid-19 virus has also generated many negative and indirect effect on the environment.to begin with, some of the developed countries have halted their sustainability program during the pandemic.', 'in the united states and in many other european nation-states, waste recycling plants have been suspended in many municipalities and cities due to the concern of the virus getting spread at the recycling centers.', 'this has resulted in an increase in the use of single-use plastic bags instead of the re-usable bags by many leading restaurants, firms, and corporations.', 'for instance, starbucks, a leading coffee company during the month of march 2020, has announced a short-lived ban on the utilization of recyclable and reusable cups.furthermore, with most of the people staying indoors because of the lockdown majority of the department stores, shops, restaurants, and food outlets are closed, making an online purchase and food delivery are quite high.', 'this has created more consumption and demand for fossil fuels due to the transportation and mobility of these goods to each individual.', 'there has been an enormous upsurge of medical waste- because most of the products employed by healthcare professionals are usually single-use items that can be used only once before they are disposed of.', 'some of these wastes include used masks, personal protection kits, and gloves.', 'for instance, nearly 200 tons of medical waste were generated during the peak of the pandemic breakout in wuhan, china.', 'this is 50 tones more than the average waste generated before the outbreak in wuhan.these organic and inorganic wastes generated due to the policies crafted by the government takes a heavy toll on the environment and can cause environmental issues like water pollution, air pollution, soil erosion, and can harm the local flora and fauna.the demand for masks during the pandemic has become skyrocketing but the materials required for the production of these masks are highly dangerous for the environment as they are generally composed of non-woven fabrics.', 'polyester, polystyrene, polyethylene, and polycarbonate, are some common materials used for the surgical mask with density lying between 20grams to 25 grams/sq.', 'meter.', 'these materials are mostly resistant to liquids and are plastic-based products with a really high afterlife after being discarded.', 'if not treated properly without discarding, they end up filling the landfills and the oceans making it dangerous to aquatic lifeforms.', 'for example, recently the environment in hong kong has started degrading drastically during the pandemic with the accumulation of these clinical wastes.with recycling plants on hold, piles of small mountains of wastes and their depositions at open areas are formed due to the increasing number of unrecycled wastes generated every day.', 'this makes the surrounding more vulnerable and also creating a high risk of air pollutions as the dumped open wastes decays into methane (ch4), a greenhouse gas, hence increasing the risk of global warming too.', 'not only the surroundings are getting affected by these careless methods, but the local people are also getting affected.', 'if the excess methane gets accumulated in the earth’s atmosphere due to piles of unrecycled wastes, this could result in increases in earth’s average temperature and can be harmful to future generations.many protected and endangered flora and fauna are facing much greater risks due to the imposition of the lockdown.', 'many countries under lockdown have made people stay inside their homes.', 'the employees, ngos, and volunteers working in these protected areas like national parks, marine conservation zones, and wildlife sanctuaries are made to stay at home making these protected and endangered flora and fauna unattended.', 'this has also led to an increase in many illegal activities like wildlife hunting, illegal deforestation, and fishing activities due to the absence of these people.', 'the prohibition of eco-tourism has also led to a significant financial drop in the economy of these protected areas.some nations like china have asked the local authorities and native government bodies to increase the amount of disinfection routine, mainly to increase the dosage of chlorine in the wastewater treatment plant to prevent the spread of the covid-19 virus.', 'however, according to who (2020), no solid evidence has been found on the survival of the virus on the lifespan of the virus in wastewater as well as in drinking water.', 'despite the fact that excessive amounts of chlorine in water can cause harmful problems and issues associated with people’s health like bladder cancer and it also damages its cells.the covid-19 is a reminder that the health of the planet is also linked to the health of humans.', 'evidence proves that the virus is zoonotic, meaning it can be transmitted between people and animals.', 'they are accountable for seventy-five percent of all emerging infectious diseases in the world.', 'with the virus infecting millions of people every day across the globe, various governments and agencies’ top priority is to regulate the spread of the virus by shifting the spotlight on the management and treatment of wastes (especially the clinical and medical waste).', 'likewise, at the same time, we as responsible individuals need to step up and follow the necessary guideline and precautions for the disposal of the waste and medical gears.in spite of various data showing that the pollutions have reduced significantly during the pandemic, history has witnessed a rise in pollution during any “post-financial crisis”.', 'a similar case was observed during the 2008 financial crash – although there was a temporary decrease in emissions of 1.3% was observed, but as the economy recovered in 2010, emissions were at an all-time high.', 'after all, only through sheer mutual empathy and goodwill that the world will emerge stronger after this global pandemic.', 'to prevent future outbreaks, we must address regularly the threats to the ecosystems and wildlife, including habitat loss, illegal trade, pollution, and climate change as human life depends on earth’s life.if you live near a spacious outdoor area, like the desert or an empty road lined with trees and you realize it’s the only safe, surface-less space to take a walk in, then you begin to realize the beauty of nature.', 'the point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with others.', 'when you do leave your home, whether it is for a walk in the desert or a run on your street, make sure to wipe down any surfaces you

      "['“data is the new oil” has become the most important trendline of the 21stcentury.', 'the reason for this is the advancements in the fields related to data analysis.', 'the field of ai machine learning statistics and data mining all deal with data and are developing at such a staggering pace, that these fields have become the most popular buzzwords these days.buzzwords are originated through technical terms but often the underlying essence is ignored through fashionable use and mainly used to impress.', 'this is the main reason for the misconception amongst people.', 'ai, ml, stats, data mining, and many other fields related to the analysis of data are most often mistook for one and the same thing, thus all these words are often used interchangeably to convey one and the same thing.', 'but this is not true at all!the only similarity between these disciplines is that all of these disciplines are related to the analysis of the data and converting this data into “information”.in academics, while learning ai machine learning statistics and data mining, the academic approach only wander in the technical definitions and concepts but the underlying essence and the aim of the discipline remain unexplored, same is the case with most of the articles out there which try to explain the difference.', 'thus, becoming the primary cause of confusion between learners.', 'hence, this article explains the difference by explaining the philosophy and the aims of each of the disciplines rather than wandering in the technical definitions.then what is the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining?the essential difference between these disciplines lies in their “aims” and the approach taken to achieve those aims.the aims of each of these fields are explained in detail in the following sections:artificial intelligence:the aim of artificial intelligence is to understand intelligent entities.', 'then to satisfy this aim, we must first understand what is intelligence and what makes an agent intelligent agent?', 'the answer to all these questions can be found by studying intelligent agents and the best example of an intelligent agent can be found by just standing in front of a mirror!', 'yes!', 'humans are the best examples of intelligent entities.', 'thus, in the 1900s, researchers began exploring the thought process, the reasoning process of humans as human beings were considered as an ideal intelligent agent.', 'mimicking human behavior became the aim of ai in the initial years of the research.', 'after setting this goal, studies and experiments began and the most famous experiment conducted in the initial years to achieve this aim was the turing test!', 'turing defined intelligent behavior as the ability to achieve human-level performance in all cognitive tasks, sufficient to fool an interrogator.', 'but this test received criticism as only mimicking human behavior is not exactly intelligence.', 'because intelligence should be related to the working of the human brain as without the human brain, intelligence has no meaning!thus, mimicking human thought processes and reasoning became the transformed aim.', 'the field of psychology and philosophy also resonate with this aim that is to understand the human thought process.', 'the difference is that ai not only tries to understand the thought process but to mimic it, build it.', 'the collaboration of these fields resulted in models such as neural networks which try to mimic the function of neurons present in the human brain.', 'so, basically, this initial aim was human-centered and humans were considered as the ideal intelligent agent.concurrently, the field of computer science was developing at a greater pace.', 'with the advances in computer science, the experiments and theories could be easily tested and validated.', 'as programs were being applied to solve real-life problems, it was found that computers performed better than humans at some tasks that are really complex for humans.', 'one of the best examples of this could be the chess-playing program.', 'an ai program defeated the world’s best chess player garry kasparov.', 'this incident indicated that human intelligence is not the ultimate intelligence or else a human would have been able to defeat the ai program.', 'this leads to a question, is human intelligence the ideal intelligence?as computers became more advanced, they proved to be better than humans at certain complex tasks.', 'that is why thenew definition of intelligencewas being related to the ability to solve cognitive tasks or problems.', 'so, rather than considering the nature of agents, researchers began to study the nature of intelligence itself.', 'then the question comes how to test or validate intelligence?', 'the best way to test intelligence is to solve cognitive problems.', 'an agent can be said intelligent only if it can solve a complex problem.', 'the problem-solving approach can be easily tested and validated on computers.', 'thus, some researchers began studying the ideal intelligence, and the selected agent to validate the experiments was the computer.', 'so, a computer and problem-solving approach were adopted.', 'so, the human-centered approach and computer, problem-solving approach are the two main aims of ai.', 'both of these fields have contributed to the field by giving valuable insights.both the aims are important and both of these collaboratively form the main aim of ai!machine learning:in the problem-solving approach, there is a big challenge that ai has to overcome in order to achieve its aim.', 'consider the example of solving a math problem.', 'there are two cases by which intelligence can be tested in this problem-solving approach.', 'let us say two math problems are given for you to solve.', 'the first problem is familiar to you and the second problem is not.consider the first problem.', 'the first problem is familiar to you, that means you know how to solve such kind of problems as you have already solved some similar problems in the past.', 'so, there comes a question, how our mind is able to solve that problem?', 'the answer is, that you have solved similar problems in the past, thus you have learned from the past data, how to solve such problems, thus even if you haven’t seen that problem in the past, you will still be able to solve similar problems.', 'this is one form of intelligence.consider another case where you are given a second problem where you have not solved such kind of problems in the past.', 'then to solve this problem, you will try to consciously gather and manipulate the given information so that you reach a certain conclusion.', 'this kind of approach does not necessarily rely on the past data but completely on the reasoning process.', 'this is the second kind of intelligence.for ai to build intelligent agents, both of these kinds of intelligence must be developed in the agent.', 'but, the reality is that ai has reached the point where it is able to build agents which can only learn from past data and find some useful information.', 'ai today has not reached a point where it can build agents who can think on their own.', 'that is the second type of intelligence.so, the way ai is able to implement the first type of intelligence is through machine learning!', 'so, the domain of ai which focuses solely on implementing the first kind of intelligence is in fact machine learning.', 'that is the reason why ml is called the subset of ai!', 'so, this is the main difference between ai and ml.technically speaking, “it is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn from past data and find some meaningful conclusions, patterns without being explicitly programmed”.', 'this statement needs some elaboration.', 'the essence of ml is related to the process of “generalization” and learning from past data.', 'generalization is an abstraction by which common properties of specific instances are formulated as general concepts or claims.', 'consider how we humans recognize daily life objects.', 'if we see an animal, then we can easily recognize if it is a “dog” or a “cat”.', 'it is a very trivial task for us but have you ever wondered how our mind is able to do it?', 'the answer is generalization!if you were given a picture of a dog, you can easily recognize that it is a picture of a dog, because, our minds have abstracted the description of a dog and formulated it into a “concept” of what a dog is and these concepts became better and better as we learned from the past experiences of a dog.', 'so, the way we think is dependent on the fact that things are represented as generalized concepts in our minds.with generalization only, can come real “information”.', 'so, we try to give computers the ability to generalize the “raw data” and convert it into “information” which can be patterns and trends in the data on their own.statistics:this is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.', 'statistics tries to deal with data with the only aim that is to explain it.', 'so, it is the study of explaining the data itself!', 'statistics has two main domains which are descriptive statistics and inferential statistics.descriptive statisticsdeals with the explanation or description of data thus the name “descriptive” statistics.', 'it tries to explain as much information as possible, easily about the whole large data which would be a very complex task otherwise.inferential statistics try to make accurate inferences from the available small data.', 'we use inference in many tasks in our daily lives.', 'consider a simple case of cooking a soup.', 'after completing the recipe, you will taste a small sample, that is, a spoonful of the soup to check if the soup tastes good or bad.', 'depending upon the result of the sample, you make an inference about the whole soup that if the soup as a whole, good or bad.', 'similarly, in statistics, there are cases where you have to apply inference to have meaningful information.', 'for example, consider a case where you cannot gather the whole data because it is very time-consuming and costly.', 'in these cases, applying inference based on the available sample introduces uncertainty.', 'that is where inferential statistics come for help.so, the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision-making in the face of uncertainty is what statistics deals with.', 'so, however, and whatever the data, statistics tries to explain that data.', 'this aim does not resonate with that of ai and ml, but statistics helpthese fields to correctly interpret the data!data mining:“data”, is not useful at all in its raw form.', 'consider examples of sensors used in industrial applications.', 'these sensors might be used in a manufacturing plant to sense different properties like temperature, pressure, etc.', 'the raw data generated by these sensors are not useful until and unless it is converted to a suitable form, then processed, analyzed to gather valuable insights, which can be used to solve a problem!due to its unique aim of capturing the essence of very large datasets, to gather insights, data mining is also referred to as “knowledge discovery”.', 'that is why, carly fiorina, former ceo of hewlett-packard once said, “the goal is to turn data into information and information into insight”.', 'this statement completely explains the aim of data mining!so, the difference between ai machine learning statistics and data mining lies in their aims.', 'but the approaches taken in all of these fields, help in one way or the other in fulfilling the aims of the other fields.', 'this is the beauty of these fields!blackcoffer insights 25: abhishek govekar, vishwakarma institute of technology, pune, india.']\n",

of the twentieth century, analysis of human consciousness has grown staggeringly after the 1950s.in sigmund freud’s psychoanalytic theory, we can see that he believed that all three levels of awareness- preconscious, conscious, and unconscious were responsible for one’s behavior and thinking.', 'he believed that the mid itself was divided into three parts- the id, the ego, and the superego.', 'the id is present at birth, instinctual, and operates according to the pleasure principle.', 'the ego underseals reality and logic and develops out of the id in infancy.', 'finally, the superego is an internalization of society’s moral standards and responsible for guilt.', 'now, the id is regarded as unconscious, whereas the ego and superego are also conscious and preconscious.', 'freud constantly revised his own clinical qualities researches, however, and didn’t conduct scientific experiments and hence his work is heavily scrutinized, leaving the questions unanswered.sigmund freud’s theory differed from the other psychologists since his theories were more understandable and very easily conveyed to the people.', 'sigmund freud’s work and hypotheses helped people shape their perspectives on youth, character, memory, sexuality, and therapy.', 'however, his theories were subject to considerable criticism both now and during his own life.', 'whilst john locke and william james took a more practical approach to the mystery by conducting experiments, sigmund freud didn’t provide any evidence to support his claims.braintoday, the essential focal point of consciousness research is on understanding what consciousness implies both biologically and mentally.', 'issues of interest include phenomena such as perception, blindsight, brainwaves during sleep, and altered states of consciousness produced by psychoactive drugs.a greater part of the test assesses consciousness by approaching human subjects for a verbal report of their encounters.', 'however, to confirm the criticalness of these verbal reports, researchers must contrast them with the action that all the while happens in the brain —that is, they should search for the neural connections of consciousness.hope is to locate that noticeable action in a specific aspect of the brain, or a particular pattern of global brain activity, will be greatly predictive of consciousness mindfulness.', 'a few brain imaging strategies, for example, eeg and mri scans, have been utilized for physical proportions of brain activities in these examinations.a few investigations have shown that movement in essential primary sensory areas of the brain isn’t adequate to create consciousness: it is workable for subjects to report an absence of awareness in any event, when areas, for example, the primary visual cortex show clear electrical reactions to a stimulus.', 'higher brain areas are viewed as all the more encouraging, particularly the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in a range of high order functions.one mainstream theory implicates various examples of brain waves in creating various conditions of consciousness.', 'analysts can record mind waves, or drawings of electrical movement inside the cerebrum, using an electroencephalograph (eeg) and placing electrodes on the scalp.', 'the four types of brain waves (alpha, beta, theta, and delta) each correspond with one mental state (relaxed, alert, lightly asleep, and deeply asleep)memoryepisodic memory can be regarded as the only form of conscious memory.', 'this is because it is the capacity to consciously remember personally experienced events and situations in the past.', 'the hippocampus located in the brain’s temporal lobe is responsible for this type of memory.consciousness also plays a part in important memory distinctions.', 'one such distinction is the implicit and explicit characteristics; in which explicit memory is what you consciously know and implicit memory includes events you may not be conscious of.furthermore, several empirical findings suggest that declarative memory is related to consciousness as well; meaning that the retrieval and formation of this memory are connected to awareness.', 'working memory operates/maintains consciously perceived information as well since it temporarily stores and tampers with information whilst working on tasks.the current ways of testing this information are lacking in several essential aspects, including spatial resolution, temporal resolution, or scope.', 'examples of such methods are pet, fmri, eeg, implanted electrodes, etc.pet and fmri have temporal resolution problems, eeg is well-known to have localizability difficulties, and implanted electrodes whilst great in temporal and spatial resolution can only test a set number of neurons; that is, they are restricted in scope.', 'hence, huge numbers of our speculations, while testable on a fundamental level, appear to be difficult to test as of now.mental illnessconsciousness has an influence on the way we see objects around us, which encourages us to settle on choices about how to communicate with them.', 'experiencing difficulty perceiving objects is connected to a few problems, for example, agnosia (a failure to decipher visual data), alzheimer’s disease, and autism.', 'however, we actually don’t comprehend what visual data is basic for the mind to intentionally perceive an object.several different disorders of consciousness include locked-in syndrome, minimally conscious state, persistent vegetative state, chronic coma, and brain death.locked-in syndrome, otherwise called pseudo coma, is a condition wherein a patient is aware however can’t move or impart verbally because of complete loss of motion of essentially all voluntary muscles in the body aside from vertical eye developments and squinting.', 'the individual is conscious and is able to speak with eye movements.in a minimally conscious state, the patient has intermittent periods of awareness and wakefulness.', 'patients need to give restricted, however reproducible indications of consciousness of themself or their current circumstance.', 'this could be following straightforward orders, comprehensible speech, or purposeful conduct.in a persistent vegetative state, the patient has sleep-wake cycles, but lacks awareness, is not able to communicate, and only displays reflexive and non-purposeful behavior.', 'the term refers to an organic body that is able to grow and develop devoid of intellectual activity or social intercourselike coma, chronic coma results generally from cortical or white-matter harm after neuronal or axonal injury, or from central brainstem sores.', 'usually, the metabolism in the grey matter decreases to 50-70% of the normal range.', 'the patient lies with eyes shut and doesn’t know about self or environmental factors.brain death is the irreversible end of all brain activity, and function (including involuntary activity necessary to sustain life).', 'the main cause is total necrosis of the cerebral neurons following loss of brain oxygenation.', 'after brain death the patient lacks any sense of awareness; sleep-wake cycles or behavior, and typically look as if they are dead or are in a deep sleep state.future predictions and conclusionas we can see from the history of scholar’s endeavors to study consciousness empirically, its nature is not one that can be defined using scientific methods.', 'in the past, psychologists such as descartes came up with dualistic theories that did not line up with the fundamental laws of physics.', 'in the battle between realists and illusionists, taking sides is fundamentally impossible as the topic doesn’t allow for concrete evidence.as we can observe from neural examinations of the brain to detect the causes of consciousness, there is no sensory sector of the brain that is the cause for one to be aware during a certain event even if there are clear signs of a reaction to a stimulus.', 'similarly, even though consciousness plays a major role in memory, we currently lack the facilities to research it fully.', 'in the future, there is a possibility that we will be able to access such facilities, however, which could allow us to find the neural connections and its ties to mental illness as well.', 'not only would this help several people by making us aware of the causes of our perspective on certain things, but it would also give us a better chance of recognizing signs of possible mental illness or other issues beforehand.as it seems, researchers continue to study this unknown part of our mind and once we are able to fund and recover from the global pandemic, we will be able to answer one of psychology’s most difficult questions.blackcoffer insights 21: amara

that in the growth of industrialization we have generated a humungous carbon footprint and colonize at outer space will create a much-needed area for our survival.with time the human race has visualized and has undergone many transformations, and these transformations may for starters were not that effective but were a major role at existence to this age.', 'be it a natural transformation like shifting of tectonic plates or manmade like dumping water and damaging water bodies, somehow have affected usual life of humans so creating space of humans is what next humans are eyeing for.all this idea for colonizing in outer space emerged when nasa was able to launch a space shuttle with a heavy payload in the late 1990s this idea didn’t stir brain at that time but later was like apple eyes when various articles from astronauts and their writeup came into limelight and this idea saw its progression, space exploration was not a new normal, companies were petrified by the number of investments that these kinds of projects ask for.', 'but things change with the entry of paypal’s owner elon musk, in 2002 where he laid stones of space x, with nasa providing the launchpad for their exploration.being space travel legitimate there where many bottlenecks knowing the nature of outer space will boost the idea of colonizing, here one has to realize the optimum.', 'but the main target that these company put forward with themself was to not just get into other planet but to get back at earth safely, earlier these projects due to high fund was always subdued and priority was given to the rocket technology.', 'thus, this unimaginable quest for the search of space was far-fetched though.now being in 2020 we do not find it out of a place of colonizing outside of space, the kind of emergence of technologies has led to the escalation of spreading the roots of human existence, the plan for reaching out to outer space too plays a key role for this idea too.', 'proper planning, analysing, organising, and executing were required for these projects to be successful for deeper know how i would like to mention here an example of space x, according to them they wud be successful for sending rockets by 2022 and would able to colonize by 2050, for achieving these vision they have planned a total of 36 times pre-launch of the same rocket which they will be launching by 2020. not only that they have already placed their star link satellites which will provide the basic network connectivity for their colonized world, they have planned this to that extent that they have targeted a profit of $ 22 billion yearly by 2025. already they have sent the first manned rocket successfully what elon musk plan is to create that infrastructure by which going to mars with cost as a regular air flight ticket all this will lead to better chances for colonizing at another planet.', 'with setting up their commercial flight once started to the red planet it wud just be a stepping stone for the colonizing at the outer space.but the fundamental change that people have to undergo while living on another planet will be a change in gravity and being able to be near to live support if any technical issues arise to their suit until unless we find a similar place like the earth that is the change which humans have to adjust.', 'aspects like ultraviolet rays too will play an immense role in the survival, but with the rate of technology expanding and challenging at very boundaries there are not many days left when we find solutions to these aspects but this idea of colonizing has more to do with monetary terms it has been projected that building a colony at space will cost at about $10 trillian which is more than many countries gdp.', 'placing that much of an amount and getting funding for such highly anticipated projects is tough.', 'elon to have addressed with these questions with an open door he believes that this cost is nothing when we find a route to colonize space and these costs will be justifiable when space exploration will reach new heights.also, our world is around water and the percentage of land comparison to water is too less.', 'whereas the population is increasing with the speed and the level of excitement in order to search for new things and the obsession with the new and innovative things never going to finish.', 'because in the end, we do not

process and increasing air and water movement into the ground.', 'they keep the ecosystem clean of dead insect carcasses and aid in the destruction and decomposition of plant and animal matter.', 'so,

unconditional attachment towards their vision.', 'everyone knows how to read a map, but which path to choose isn’t something that can be taught.', 'leaders give the direction or vision to the company

towards a problem, and how well they guide and hire others to get the job done, which is also evident as per the managerial skills required as per robert katz.though it can be argued that technical experts are also the great leaders in their areas, but these leaders are generally at the middle management level.', 'as per the different leadership styles, a servant leader is the one who always tries to achieve the goal of the team.', 'these leaders are the ones who have a management objective laid out in front of them and they drive the team closer to achieving the target by having the people-first mindset, a collaborative approach towards solving the problem.', 'these are the people or the leaders needed at the execution level of the project or those who are too close to the

probably know how to code so that he or she can help the team in achieving the target of producing less garbage which might be one of the project’s kpis.', 'the project manager, who might be an operations manager, (#mba) from an it background, probably need not know what line of code is to be written but should know the algorithms or the logic behind the code so that he or she can validate the code from the client’s perspective.', 'the ceo, might not be from an it background but should know how to run an it firm rather than the syntax of the code.but in today’s competitive world leaders

a novel solution to many problems that the world is facing today.', 'there is another group of people who are merely threatened by the thought of ai taking over the world.the field of ai took birth when alan turing in 1950 had this thought “can machines think?”.', 'later in the 1980s, with the adoption of “expert systems” by the companies around the world, the booming of the field of ai was initiated.', 'initially, it was a matter of awe for everyone to see the results of what ai can achieve.', 'ai’s growth in the past few decades has been exponential and it has transformed the way we live, work and solve challenges.', 'ai has made its impact in a wide variety of areas including healthcare, education, business and many more.', 'but, one of the areas of highest impact that ai has made recently is in the environment and climate change.is ai revolutionizing the way we deal with environment and climate change?ai can strengthen climate predictions, enable smarter decision-making for decarbonising industries from building to transport, and work out how to allocate renewable energy.', 'in recent years, ai has been a game-changer in how many people, as well as organizations, deal with climate change.', 'microsoft believes that artificial intelligence, often encompassing machine learning and deep learning, is a “game-changer” for climate change and environmental issues.', 'the company’s ‘ai for earth’ program has committed $50 million over five years to create and test new applications for ai.ai is increasingly used to manage the intermittency of renewable energy so that more can be incorporated into the grid; it can handle power fluctuations and improve energy storage as well.', 'wind companies are using ai to get each turbine’s propeller to produce more electricity per rotation by incorporating real-time weather and operational data.ai can also improve energy efficiency on the city scale by incorporating data from smart meters and the internet of things (the internet of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects, enabling them to send and receive data) to forecast energy demand.', 'besides, artificial intelligence systems can simulate potential zoning laws, building ordinances, and flood plains to help with urban planning and disaster preparedness.', 'one vision for a sustainable city is to create an “urban dashboard” consisting of real-time data on energy and water use and availability, traffic and weather to make cities more energy-efficient and livable.hotter temperatures will have significant impacts on agriculture as well.', 'data from sensors in the field that monitor crop moisture, soil composition and temperature help ai improve production and know when crops need watering.', 'incorporating this information with that from drones, which are also used to monitor conditions, can help increasingly automatic ai systems know the best times to plant, spray and harvest crops, and when to head off diseases and other problems.', 'this will result in increased efficiency, enhanced yields, and lower use of water, fertilizer and pesticides.but, is ai as good as it looks or does it have a downside?when we talk about the effect of ai in the environment and climate, both sides of the coin must be elucidated.', 'so, apart from all the positives discussed above, the usage of ai also has a downside.last year’s world economic forum report showed that while ai can address some of earth’s environmental challenges, it is important to manage it properly.', 'according to the forum and experts in the field, ai has the potential to accelerate environmental degradation.', 'the use of power-intensive gpus to run machine learning training has already been cited as contributing to increased c02 emissions.although ai has been around for about half a century, the question of environmental impact – and other ethical issues – is only arising now because the techniques developed over decades can now be used in combination with an explosion in data and strong computational power.for all the advances enabled by artificial intelligence, from speech recognition to self-driving cars, ai systems consume a lot of power and can generate high volumes of climate-changing carbon emissions.a study last year found that training an off-the-shelf ai language-processing system produced 1,400 pounds of emissions – about the amount produced by flying one person roundtrip between new york and san francisco.', 'but there are ways to make machine learning cleaner and greener, a movement that has been called “green ai.” some algorithms are less power-hungry than others, for example, and many training sessions can be moved to remote locations that get most of their power from renewable sources.the key, however, is for ai developers and companies to know how much their machine learning experiments are spewing and how much those volumes could be reduced.what can be done?to prevent this, the proposition by the world economic forum report is that advancements in “safe” ai should be pursued, to ensure that humanity is not developing ai that is harmful to the environment.', 'specifically, the world economic forum said in its report that ai developers “must incorporate the health of the natural environment as a fundamental dimension.” this means safeguarding against models that will demand the consumption of energy or natural resources beyond what is sustainable, among other factors.', 'in a sense, all programs need to be designed with the dimension of environmental protection and improvement in mind.in the future development of ai programs, it will also be important to note the environmental impact of creating these systems in the first place.', 'according to an academic study on energy usage for deep learning processes, the creation of an effective ai might be costly to the environment.', 'nearly 300,000 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions are created during the process of training a single model.', 'this is basically equal to the emissions of five average cars in the united states.', 'considering the negative environmental impact in addition to the positive implications of ai and climate change will be crucial, moving forward.there is always room for improvement, some pioneers of machine learning recently published a paper calledtackling climate change with machine learningwas discussed at a major ai conference.', 'david rolnick, a postdoctoral fellow of the university of pennsylvania said “call to arms” which means to bring researchers together.this paper covers thirteen areas of research where machine learning can be used, including energy production, co2 removal, education, solar geoengineering, finance and many more.', 'the main idea is to build more energy-efficient buildings, creating new low-carbon materials, high tech monitoring of deforestation and greener transportation sources.', 'artificial intelligence and machine learning can be a medium but the real work is to be done by us as a caretaker of mother earth.how about better forecasting of climate change?the kick start was already done byclimate informaticsin 2011 which regulates the collaboration of data science and climate science.', 'it covers a wide range of topics like improving prediction of extreme events such as hurricanes, paleoclimatology, collecting data from ice cores, climate up-down scaling and its impact on us.“there’s a lot of uncertainty,” monteleoniclaire monteleoni, a computer science professor at the university of colorado concludes that ai/ ml models generally forecast for the short-term.', 'there is a significant difference when it comes to long-term forecasting.the first system was developed at princeton in the 1960s.', 'all the ai/ ml models developed till now revolve around atmosphere, oceans, land, cryosphere or ice.', 'ai can help to achieve new heights with the amount of data collected at this point of time, and compute more complex climate conditions using climate modeling algorithms.what about showing the effects of extreme weather?we all know that climate change is real and the rise in atmospheric temperature the proof, but to make it more realistic, montreal institute of learning algorithms (mila), microsoft and conscientai labs uses generative adversarial networks popularly know as gans to simulate what mother earth will look like with the rising sea levels, atmospheric temperature, air pollution and intensive storms.“our goal is not to convince people climate

look at what their places will look like in the future when there will be a significant climate change.can we track carbon emissions?short answer, yes.', 'tracking of carbon emission is one of the

a short span.investors were now looking for a brighter option than investing in stock markets.fig –rise and fall of the dot com bubbleas interest rates went lower and lower, real estate prices started rising and the us govt also encouraged people to buy houses and properties.', 'the demand for the same started rising rapidly and investors now found a great option to invest in (i.e.', 'in real estate).during that same time, investment banks saw an opportunity, chimed in and started buying loans from banks in bulk and clubbed multiple loans under a complex derivative called cdo

with good credit history and regular income people.', 'but in the hope of getting even more credit from investment banks, these same banks then started giving out subprime housing loans to people with

lower interests at the start but more interest rates later on.the borrowers started defaulting on these loans when the interest rates increased dramatically around 2007 and thus banks had to then resell those houses to make up for the loans defaulted.', 'added to the problem was the fact that borrowers were not spending any amount of money from their pockets while taking loans and banks were providing the full amount of loans.', 'almost 50% of the borrowers did not pay anything from their own pocket and bought the home only using the housing loan.this led to a huge increase in the defaulters of borrowers and ultimately banks had to auction houses to gain credit back.', 'with the high-interest rates and no one to buy the auctioned houses, this ultimately caused a chain reaction and banks were no longer receiving credit.', 'the prices of real estate started falling drastically and people with good credit scores who had earlier taken housing loans also started defaulting

came down to 0.some investors went for huge losses and few investment companies went bankrupt (ex – lehman brothers).', 'moreover, insurance companies had to pay back those investors who had taken insurance.', 'as a result, some of the insurance companies also went bankrupt.', 'aig too almost lost about $100bn in paying back the investors who had earlier insured their cdos.', 'however, the us govt.', 'finally decided to bail out aig in order to save them from going bankrupt.cdos and cdss were not regulated during that time by the federal reserve and thus this whole situation ultimately led

spreads because not only are they a (usually) a leisure spending but also the nature of the disease directly conflicts with the industries’ innate business models.', 'in this article, we will look at the impact of covid-19 pandemic on the tourism and aviation industries both from the demand side and the supply side.the aviation and tourism industries has two major customers: tourists and business travellers.', 'let us base this essay in the india and see what the reaction of the customer segments is expected to be like.almost all touristswill avoid vacationing for the foreseeable future

still have a job are facingpay-cuts, furloughsand deferment of salaries.risk of contraction: because the disease spreads via social contact, it will only be safe to vacation if the destination is regularlysanitizedand is not crowded.', 'inherently, tourist destinations are not compliant with these regulations and even if the industry makes a change to being clean and introducingsocial distancing measures, convincing risk averse tourists of to travel to these vacation spots will be difficult.expansion of alternatives ways to relax:as most people adapt to work-from-home environments, the burnout rate is declining.', 'people are more relaxed in their own homes and very few people are eagerly looking for a getaway.', 'combined with this deterrent is the rise of alternative ways to relax.', 'more and more people are going out forwalks, doingyogaand finding new hobbies.', 'due to this increase for pursuit for happiness at home, it might be likely that tourists will avoid traveling because they don’t feel the urge to break-free and move away for a holiday.now, let us look at different types of holiday revellers.', 'tourists can be foreigners or domestic tourists.',

this business has been lost.due to the reasons stated above mostforeignerswill not prefer to travel.', 'those who do dare to venture out, perhaps wooed bydiscounted dealsto places which would have otherwise been out of their budgets, will possibly be warded off by the one of the following factors:poor quality of health care in india: in the off chance that a tourist contracts covid-19, they will probably be accustomed to a better healthcare system than the one india provides.', 'being a developing country india will find it hard to convince foreign tourists that our healthcare systems are up to the mark of their home countries.densely populated regions around tourist destinations: because most tourist destinations support a neighbouring economy, the areas are often densely populated, which leads to a higher risk of transmission of covid-19 and the foreign tourists are cognizant of this fact.moving our focus to domestic tourists, we subdivide our population according to income levels:below poverty line: these people don’t travellower income families: these people majorly only travel toreligious placesor tovisit family.', 'thus, they don’t contribute to the aviation industry at all and generate very little revenue for the tourism industry as they prefer to stay in cheap lodges or at a relative’s place.middle income families: they travel once in a year or two and tend to avoid airplanes.', 'revenue in the tourism industry is also limited from this subsection.upper middle income families: theyvacation regularly, often flying to near-by holiday spots.', 'this section of our economy is severely hit by the coronavirus’financial hardships.', 'people have lost jobs and almost everyone has low liquidity.', 'beingrisk averse, these people will probably save money and avoid spending on vacations for some time.', 'the loss of volumes from this sector will affect the aviation and tourism industries severely.high income families: this sector is relativelyinsulatedfrom the financial hardships caused by coronavirus and is likely to spend on holidays if they areassuredof the sanitization and social distancing.in order to attract well paying customers, the aviation and tourism industries will have tospenda considerable amount ofmoneyto becomesanitation compliantwhich will push profit margins even lower.', 'most aviation and tourism activities mademoney not on individual margins but on collective volumes, thus, they are inherently incompatible with the concept of social distancing.because of covid-19 pandemic, businesses have realized that more and more meetings can be handled over video calls, thus, themovementofbusiness personnelwill berestricted.', 'there will still be some representatives who will fly out to conduct business, but the industry can expect apermanent drop in revenuefrom this sector.moving over to the supply side, the aviation and tourism industries face strongdisruptions in their supply chain.', 'because the industry is a leisure expense,manufacturingof many supporting equipment like the adventure sports gears and even parts of planes themselves hasstopped.', 'because of thedrop in demand, it is going to be tough to get the supply chain back up again.', 'furthermore,workersareafraid to show upto their jobs because of the high risk of contracting the virus due to exposure to multiple

depend on the owner’s rental income which made the problem worse.hosts usually decidecancellationpolicy, but under extreme circumstances, like this one, the company decided to override all existing policies (many of whom weren’t strict) and gave full refund to the guests.', 'the company got $2 billion loan and has helped out the owners, financially by paying 25% for cancelled bookings capping at 5k/host.', 'they have helped some hosts by getting them eligible for small business loans and avoid eviction.thankfully, there are too few properties to cause ahousing crisis, but breakdown could cause strain on lenders and undermine property values (all want to sell to avoid foreclosure or defaulting on loans).', 'airdna states that the listing split-up for airbnb is: 33% list single property, 33% owners list 2-24 properties, 33% hosts have 25+ properties.some state governments in america havebanned short-term rentals.', 'this hurt the airbnb owners because people looking to quarantine outside their homes or near relatives could’ve generated revenues.so, what are hosts doing now?many are discounting units and looking for long-term tenants (12 months).', 'many are planning to apply for a small-business loan, seek forbearance from banks, find long-term tenants independently of airbnb and sell property.reluctance of workers to comeback to work (america):according to the wall street journal, roughly half of all us workers stand to earn more from the coronavirus rather than their work pay cheques.', 'however, it must be noted that some have not gotten their money due to bureaucratical issues.thiscomplicates reopeningbecause workers don’t want to come back and expose themselves to the virus and earn less.', 'but businesses want workers to come back so that their small business loans can be forgiven, and business can reopen.', 'however, money in the consumer’s pockets means the economy expected to rebound quickly when businesses open.', 'about 40 million americans are now on unemployment benefits, majorly from restaurant, hospitality, and retail industries.congress chosea flat amount of reliefbecause it was really time-consuming for payments to be calibrated to each worker’s lost wages.', 'their $600 federal payment corresponds to $15/hours wage, but 21 states follow $7.25/hours.most workers don’t want to sit at home and are anxious to get back to work, but right now staying at home is thesmartest financial decisionfor their families.workers should be ineligible for unemployment benefits if a job is made available to them.',

support, low-wage workers would likely seek out other jobs, including side hustles and gig work, which could expose them and their households to the virus.', 'thus, according to the government, it was important to give such a large stimulus to the economy.coronavirus on planes:studies of sars suggested that people sitting close to infectious persons were at large risk.', 'combined with that, in long journeys, passengers may take off masks.', 'thus, therisks oftransmissionare large and airlines need to focus on figuring out how to prevent transmission in planes.currently, the airlines plan on

ratings sabyasachi majumdar said, “the lockdown imposed by the government is likely to adversely impact the all india electricity demand, with demand expected to decline by about 20-25% on a year-on-year basis during the period of lockdown.', 'this would in turn adversely impact the revenues and cash collections for distribution utilities in the near term, especially given the consumption decline from the high tariff paying industrial and commercial consumers and likely delays in cash collections from other consumer segments.', 'the revenue deficit for the discoms is estimated to be about rs.', '130 billion per month, on an all india basis.', 'this would in turn adversely impact the liquidity profile of the discoms, increase their subsidy requirement, and lead to delays in payments to the power generation and transmission companies.”the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies.the power ministry on friday issued directors to the central electricity regulatory commission to provide a moratorium of three months to discoms on payments to power generation and transmission companies and requested state governments to issue similar directions to state electricity regulators.the power generation companies are already suffering delays in payments by discoms across the majority of states, with payment due of more than rs 85000 crore as of november 2019 at all india level as per the data on praapti portal.with covid-19 lockdown accentuating the delays in payments, the availability of adequate liquidity buffer in the form of debt service reserve and undrawn working capital limits remains important from a credit perspective.however, it said that relief measures such as a moratorium on debt servicing over a 3-month period as notified by reserve bank of india and expected moderation in the interest rate cycle would be a source of comfort in the near term.', 'the timely approval of the moratorium by the boards of the banks and financial institutions remains crucial.the revenues for power generation companies having long-term power purchase agreements (ppas) with the state distribution utilities (discoms) will be protected by the provision for capacity charges linked to plant availability in case of thermal and large hydropower projects and “must-run” status in case of nuclear and renewable power projects.average monthly thermal plf would further dip to 50-52% against 63% in the corresponding period of the previous year, due to a considerable drop in demand and consequently, power generation companies especially those without any long-term ppas would be adversely impacted given the weakening of the power tariffs in the short-term / power exchange market, said icra ratings sector head & vice president girishkumarkadam.the under-construction renewable power projects as well as epc and manufacturing companies in the solar segment are likely to face execution delays because of disruption in the supply chain in india and labor availability, following the lockdown.', 'given the import dependency on china for sourcing pv modules, the execution timelines for the ongoing solar projects are likely to be affected by delays in the delivery of pv modules following the outbreak of covid 19 in china.this delay in turn would increase the pre-operative expenses and the overall project cost, which in turn would have an impact on the expected returns.in this context, the mnre has notified that time extension can be provided for all renewable energy projects, which are impacted by the supply chain disruption due to the covid outbreak, under the force majeure clause.“given the execution headwinds amid covid 19 affecting q1 of fy2020-21 and assuming the normalcy thereafter, the capacity addition in the wind and solar segments together is likely to degrow by about 25%, thus estimated at about 8 gw against earlier estimates of 11 gw in fy2020-21,” said kadam.figure: cleared volume (above) and market clearing price (below) for iex between march

wherein employees tend to show that they work very hard but they don’t.', 'this might be practiced by showing the boss that they are working when he is on around, and then chilling the rest of the time when the boss goes home or sits in his office.', 'in fact, employees might also lose interest in working if they sense repeated partialities and inequalities; which they might show by quitting the jobs or not performing to their best.such situations will definitely arise in companies and offices; wherein employees will compete for attention and resources; which will have a great impact on the company and its functioning.', 'and all this will happen because of only one thing;

to compensate for the losses being born and to make better use of the money being used.', 'however, the number of resources will be the same, and so, there will be a case of competition between employees of different companies to use resources and take benefits of the same.if the above two situations happen to occur at the same time (which they most likely will), we will observe a scene of intra-company as well as inter-company competition.', 'also, our personal relations with other employees in the company might also be affected due to this comparison and competition;
